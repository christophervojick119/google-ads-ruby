    # ## Enabling Logging
    #
    # To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library.
    # The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below,
    # or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/#/docs/google-cloud-logging/latest/google/cloud/logging/logger)
    # that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb)
    # and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.
    #
    # Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # require "logger"
    #
    # module MyLogger
    #   LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
    #   def logger
    #     LOGGER
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # # Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
    # module GRPC
    #   extend MyLogger
    # end
    # ```
